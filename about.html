		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		I discovered coding purely by accident. I started working for a dot com in 1998 - just as the internet was emerging from it's infancy. I worked for RealEstate.com. We started as a B2C web site, then suddenly we changed to a B2B web site. In all honesty, it was a web site ahead of it's time. Already we were building apps to run templated web sites for realtors, title agents and house inspectors. <br /><br />
     
     While the services were well received - people were not ready to sign up. So our bubble burst and with it, the company. From there, I went on to work for a title agent who loved that I had background in real estate! I stayed with that company for about ten years then decided I was ready to try contracting. I have have been working for myself for about 6 years now and have never regretted one minute of it. 

      <h4>Where am I (from)?</h4>
     Originally, I am from coastal North Carolina. I grew up avoiding tourists and thinking the beach was the best place to be in the winter. Growing up in a small town, I couldn't wait to move to the big city. Any big city would work. First I moved to Raleigh, NC</span>, followed by Atlanta, GA and now I live in Washington, DC.
